Things to do :-
This should contain content that will introduce you and provide a call to action to contact you. You want to stand out
from the crowd, so consider what elements make the most sense on this page without duplicating your content from your
other pages. This page should have key points, but not go into depth on any specific skill as your about page will be
responsible for that
